cd [dir]

Change the current directory to dir.

If dir is not supplied, the value of $HOME is the default.

Any additional arguments following dir are ignored.

$CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing dir:
	- each directory name in CDPATH is searched for dir. 
	- Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:). 
	- A null directory name in CDPATH is the same as the current directory, i.e. '.'. 

If dir begins with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.

If .. appears in dir, it is processed by removing the immediately previous path-
name component from dir, back to a slash or the beginning of dir.

An argument of - is converted to $OLDPWD before the directory change is attempted.

If a nonempty directory name from CDPATH is used, or if - is the first argument,
and the directory change is successful, the absolute pathname of the new working
directory is written to the standard output.

The return value is true if the directory was successfully changed; false otherwise.
